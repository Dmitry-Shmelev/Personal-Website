# Personal Website


## Description

This is my personal website. I developed it with Django on backend and Bootstrap4 on frontend, Posgresql by database. You can change your projects in page by adding them to database at admin.


## Installation

You have to install virtualenv in your project directory and activate it.

```bash
$ python3 -m venv virtual/env
$ source virtual/env/bin/active
```

In your virtual environment, install django and all requirement libraries.

```bash
(env)$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run your server by this script.

```bash
(env)$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

You can see my website at https://localhost:8000.

Also go into admin panel at https://localhost:8000/admin
